# client-server-in-C-language
In this project, you are expected to write a client-server based application that solves the linear equation of the form    with  being the input matrix ,  is the vector of unknowns and  is the output vector using 3 different methods. You are also expected to evaluate the server performance for (i)thread-per-request, and (ii)worker pool before request based implementations (server program needs to be implemented twice).
